### Coding Conventions

Please follow these rules when adding new code to the repository.

* Use 4 spaces for indentation.
* Use double quotes `""` for strings or single quotes `''` if the string itself contains double quotes.
* Declare functions with `local function <name>()`, **not** `local <name> = function()`.
* Try to make your code as clean and readable as possible.
* Add as many or few comments as you like but make them comprehensible.
* Don't repeat yourself; if you use a piece of code multiple times, make it a function or a variable.
* Don't use single letter names. e.g use `name` instead of `n`.
* Add anotations such as `@param`, `@return`, `@type` and `@class`.
