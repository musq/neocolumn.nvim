```lua
{
    -- these colors will be used on the neocolumn
    colors = {
        normal = "#7d7d7d",     -- the color of the neocolumn
        error = "#db4b4b",      -- the color of the neocolumn on lines with an error
        error_near = "#ad6565", -- the color of the neocolumn on lines next to a line with an error
        error_far = "#957171",  -- the color of the neocolumn on lines 2 lines away from a line with
                                -- an error
        warn = "#e0af68",       -- the color of the neocolumn on lines with a warning
        warn_near = "#af9672",  -- the color of the neocolumn on lines next to a line with a warning
        warn_far = "#968a78",   -- the color of the neocolumn on lines 2 lines away from a line with
                                -- a warning
        info = "#0db9d7",       -- the color of the neocolumn on lines with an info diagnostic
        info_near = "#459cab",  -- the color of the neocolumn on lines next to a line with an info
                                -- diagnostic
        info_far = "#618c94",   -- the color of the neocolumn on lines 2 lines away from a line with

        bg = "#303030",         -- the background color of the neocolumn
        cursor_bg = "#4d4d4d"   -- the background color of the neocolumn on the same line as the
                                -- cursor
    }
    -- neocolumn.nvim will be disabled in buffers with these filetypes
    exclude_filetypes = {
        "help",
        "man"
    },
    -- When enabled, the neocolumn will be colored depending on each line's diagnostics
    diagnostics = true,
    -- If `diagnostics` is `true` then diagnostic with a severity lower than this will be ignored
    min_diagnostic_severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.HINT,
    -- The maximum allowed length for a line. The neocolumn will be placed one column to the right
    max_line_length = 100,
    -- The character use as the neocolumn
    character = "â”‚",
    -- The neocolumn will be shown only if the length of the current line is this close to it
    max_distance = 0
}
```
